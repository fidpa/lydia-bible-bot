## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include:

- A clear and descriptive title

- Your environment (Bun version, OS, Node version)
- Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome. Please provide:

- A clear description of the problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternative solutions you've considered

### Pull Requests

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Run type checking**:
   ```bash
   bun run typecheck
   ```

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, fix all type errors before committing
- **Immutability**: Create new objects instead of mutating existing ones
- **Error handling**: Wrap risky operations in try/catch with descriptive messages
- **File size**: Keep files under 800 lines, extract when growing beyond
- **Functions**: Keep under 50 lines, single responsibility
- **No `console.log`**: Use the audit logging utilities in `src/utils.ts`

### Commit Message Format
